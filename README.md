# Malicious-URL-Detection
This project detects malicious URLs (phishing, malware, defacement) using character-level tokenization and deep learning models including LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Transformer. Trained on 650k+ URLs, the CNN-LSTM model achieves high accuracy, enabling robust real-world cybersecurity protection.
